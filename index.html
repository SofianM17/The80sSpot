                    This project was created using Javascript, CSS, and HTML.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The original image of the television was modified in Adobe Photoshop. The UF channel dial and power dial were cut out
                    from the original image to be animated using CSS keyframe animations triggered using Javascript. The screen of the 
                    television was also removed from the original image of the TV, and was reduced in opacity and used as an overlay over the content
                    being played.
                </p>
                <p> 
                    Edits were also made to the videos that are played on the television. Firstly, clips from iconic 80's movies / TV shows were extracted using Adobe Premiere Pro.
                    Most of the clips extracted were scenes that portrayed action sequences to capture the viewer's interest immediately or were iconic scenes from
                    an 80's show or movie that would be recognizable relatively easily. Music videos were kept entirely, as they were quite short. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Many of these videos were also modified to include a "channel surfing" distortion effect when the user clicks the channel dial to change the video being played. This was done to
                    simulate the experience of watching television in the 80's. A highpass filter and distortion effect was also added to the audio of many of the videos to complement this
                    visual effect.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Not only were CSS keyframe animations used for the TV's dials, but also for the blinking "no signal" label, which displays the name of the content being played once the television turns on
                    (implemented using Javascript) and for the flickering "The 80's Spot" page header when the page is loaded or refreshed for a neon sign effect.
                </p>

                <p>
                    A random video is displayed whenever the TV is powered on to prevent repetitiveness.
